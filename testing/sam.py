'''Question 1: Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.'''

# num1 = int(input("Enter 1st Number:"))

# print("diff of 2 numbers", num1-num2)
# print("prod of 2 numbers", num1*num2)

# val = input("Enter your value to know DataType:")

#     print("Datatype of your value is Integer")
# elif '.' in val:
#     print("Datatype of your value is Float")
# elif isinstance(val, bool):
#     print("Datatype of your value is Boolean")
# else:

'''Question 3: Take a float number from the user, cast it to an integer, and print both the original and the casted value.'''

# f_num = float(input("Enter the float number:"))
# print("Original float value:", f_num)

'''Question 4: Write a program that compares two numbers and prints True if the first number is greater, otherwise prints False.'''
